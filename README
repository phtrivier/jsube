This is the javascript version of UBE, a puzzle game.

Your goal is to traverse a maze, using only a limited number of moves.

Each move has a different properties. The green move lets you move
between adjacent cells of the puzzle ; the yellow one lets you move
two cells at a time, the purple move lets you move three cells a
time. The brown move lets you move kinda like a knight in chess.

The game should be available at :

Development is not in progress any more, but feel free to drop a note
if you have ideas for levels and want to take on ! 

Have fun.
